Utilities for managing [Datalog](http://docs.datomic.com/query.html) rulesets from Clojure.

By Datalog, we mean the rules language exposed by Datomic and Datascript 
 (because of the data-orientation of Datalog, this library doesn't have any code dependency to either of those).

Project status: alpha, subject to breaking changes.

## Usage

See [tests](test/datalog_rules/test/api.clj) for usage example.

## TODO

* docs
* tree shaking
